## FaceCamera

This is a simplified version of snapface (http://code.google.com/p/android-playground-erdao/wiki/SnapFace).

It could serve as a starting point if all you want to do is integrate the android hardware camera with the android face detect api.

### Using
Download the source.  Run it and place the camera in portrait mode about 15-30 centimeters away from your face.  Once the camera detects your face a new activity will be launched.

### Caveats
This currently only uses rear facing camera and I haveo only tested it on motorolly milestone.

It only seems to work in landscape for some reason.
